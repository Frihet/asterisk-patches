To install, simply copy the files to the 'sounds' directory of
Asterisk. In debian based installations this directory is placed in
/usr/share/asterisk, and for source installs it is /var/lib/asterisk
pr. default.

If you wish to keep the defaults or have several sound installations,
keep the nb_NO file structure and make the appropriate changes in
say.conf.
